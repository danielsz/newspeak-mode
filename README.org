* Newspeak mode

Major mode (/Emacs/) for the [[https://newspeaklanguage.org/][Newspeak]] programming language.

/Caveat emptor/: This is a work in progress.

** Installation

*** MELPA

Newspeak mode will be available via the MELPA repository. Meanwhile, please refer to the section below.

*** Manually

- Clone this repository.
- Add the following to your initialization file (e.g. ~init.el~):
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/path/to/newspeak-mode"))
(require 'newspeak-mode)
#+end_src

** Features

*** Syntax highlighting

Fully configurable under the customization group ~newspeak-mode-faces~.

The following are different ways to customize syntax highlighting of Newspeak mode, and all are equally valid.

- ~M-x customize~ and type ~newspeak-mode-faces~ in the search bar.
- ~M-x customize-group~ and select ~newspeak-mode-faces~
- ~M-x customize-face~, type ~newspeak--~ and press ~TAB~ for completion.
   
The font lock system is mapped onto Newspeak constructs in the following way.

| Font lock          | Newspeak construct       |
|--------------------+--------------------------|
|                    |                          |
| Builtin Face       | Access modifiers         |
| Comment Face       | Comments                 |
| Constant Face      | Reserved keywords        |
| Function Name Face | Keyword and setter sends |
| Keyword Face       | Block arguments          |

Modify the faces at will.
